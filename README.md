# Kickstarter
## Description
Kickstarter campaigns make ideas into reality. It’s where creators share new visions for creative work with the communities that will come together to fund them. 

## The Problem & Our Mission
Our client wants to launch a Kickstarter campaign but is unsure how to structure it for success — from choosing the right category to setting goals and engaging backers. 

This project aims to analyze key trends in Kickstarter data and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to help design a campaign with a higher chance of success.

### 4. Key Takeaways
**SUCCESS RATES ACROSS KICKSTARTER PROJECTS BY CATEGORIES AND FUNDING GOALS**
- High goals ≠ high success: Games and Technology ask for the most but often underperform.
- Lower goals = higher success: Dance, Comics, and Theater have small goals and top success rates.
- Creative categories win: Arts-focused campaigns consistently outperform tech-driven ones.
- Recommendation: For higher chances of success, choose a creative category and set a realistic, modest goal.

**SETTING THE RIGHT TARGET: GOALS IN SUCCESSFUL VS. UNSUCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS**
- Successful projects tend to aim lower — they ask for modest amounts, which are easier to reach.
- It doesn't mean that setting a low goal guarantees success, but it does show that realistic, well-calibrated goals are more often met.
- If a new campaign wants to increase its chances of success, it might consider setting a goal close to or below this average, unless their strategy or category justifies going higher.

**TIME VS. SUCCESS: WHAT’S THE IDEAL CAMPAIGN LENGTH?**

The best campaigns usually run for about 20 to 40 days. It’s long enough to get people interested but short enough to keep the excitement and encourage quick support.

**SEASONAL STRATEGY: WHEN TO LAUNCH FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT?**

We noticed a sharp decline in campaign success during May, likely due to reasons such as seasonal distractions, lower consumer spending, Increased competition, and reduced online engagement. For optimal visibility and pledges, we recommend launching in Q1 or during the second half of the year, avoiding the May slump.

**ANALYZING THE ROLE REWARD TEIRS IN CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE**

Successful campaigns offer more reward levels, giving backers a wider range of options and increasing the likelihood of engagement and pledges.

### 5. Limitations
1. **Outdated Data:**
   The dataset contains campaigns from earlier years, which may not reflect current platform algorithms, user expectations, or industry trends.
   
2. **Category Imbalance:**
   Some categories have far more campaigns than others, potentially biasing conclusions toward overrepresented project types.
   
3. **Lack of Behavioral Metrics:**
   We don’t have data on user behavior (e.g. views, click-throughs, time on page), which limits our ability to understand what truly drives engagement.
   
4. **External Influences:**
   Dataset likely doesn’t account for external marketing efforts, social media presence, or creator reputation, which strongly impact success.
